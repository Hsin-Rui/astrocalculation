\title{This function calculate planetary positions and other chart elements by calling functions in swephR
planetary positions are calculated by calling swe_calc_ut()
ASC, MC, Vertex and house cusps are calculated by calling swe_houses_ex()
swe_calc_ut returns 6 double parameters: 1. longitude, 2. latitude, 3. distance, 4. speed in longitude, 5. speed in latitude, 6. speed in distance}
\usage{
calculate_planet_position(date, timezone, city)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{A POSIXct class date time string}

\item{timezone}{A string of time zone. It has to be time zone that lubridate recognizes. Default is "Asia/Taipei"}

\item{city}{A character string of city along with longitude and latitude (acquired in cities dataset)}
